<p class="text">"Only one more, papa; only for Mr. Elton. Poor Mr. Elton! You like Mr. 
                 Elton, papa,--I must look about for a wife for him. There is nobody in Highbury
                 who deserves him--and he has been here a whole year, and has fitted up his house 
                 so comfortably, that it would be a shame to have him single any longer--and I 
                 thought when he was joining their hands to-day, he looked so very much as if
                 he would like to have the same kind office done for him! I think very well of Mr
                 Elton,<span class="dots">...</span><span class="moreText"> and this is the only way
                 I have of doing him a service."

                 "Mr. Elton is a very pretty young man, to be sure, and a very good young man, and 
                 I have a great regard for him. But if you want to shew him any attention, my dear,
                 ask him to come and dine with us some day. That will be a much better thing. I dare
                 say Mr. Knightley will be so kind as to meet him."
    
                 "With a great deal of pleasure, sir, at any time," said Mr. Knightley, laughing,
                 "and I agree with you entirely, that it will be a much better thing. Invite him to.
